# gcn-data-alignment

This is a Python implementation of subspace alignment measure (SAM) for quantitying the alignment of graph and features in deep learning, as described in our paper:
 
Yifan Qian, Paul Expert, Tom Rieu, Pietro Panzarasa, and Mauricio Barahona (forthcoming), [Quantifying the alignment of graph and features in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12921), *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems*.


Installation
------------

```python setup.py install```

Run the demo
------------
```
cd alignment
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```

How to use the code
------------
```python
from alignment.optimizations import optimize_dim_subspaces

optimize_dim_subspaces(
    dataset="constructive_example",
    num_rdm=2,
    num_k=5,
    num_scanning=1,
    norm_type="Frobenius-Norm",
    log=False,
    heatmap=True
)
```
